# CppCrashCourse
Welcome to my cpp crashcourse. There may be several things wrong with this tutorial so please point them out by messaging me (or by fixing it yourselves and pushing to this repo)

Linux:
	- Requisites
		g++ or some other c++ compiler
		A terminal of any kind

Windows:
	Click test in whatever IDE you are using. Make sure you set the thing to c++, NOT C. C is different than c++.

Mac:
	I don't have the money to buy apple, so you are on your own. Compiling is easy. Bug fixing is harder.
