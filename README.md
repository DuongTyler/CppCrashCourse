# CppCrashCourse
Welcome to my cpp crashcourse. There may be several things wrong with this tutorial so please point them out by messaging me (or by fixing it yourselves and pushing to this repo)
<ul>
	<dt>Linux:
		<ul>
			<li>run g++ <file.cpp>. You must have g++ installed, or your choice of compiler</li>
		</ul>
	</dt>
	<dt>Windows:
		<ul>
			<li>Click test, run, or whatever it is you need to click in your windows IDE</li>
		</ul>
	</dt>
	<dt>Mac:
		<ul>
			<li>You should know how to compile on mac. Just throw money at the screen if all else fails, and apple will compile it for you</li>
		</ul>
	</dt>
</ul>
